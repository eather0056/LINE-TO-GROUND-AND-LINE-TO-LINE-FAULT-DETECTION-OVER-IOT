# LINE-TO-GROUND-AND-LINE-TO-LINE-FAULT-DETECTION-OVER-IOT
This project utilizes Arduino and IoT to determine the exact location of line-to-ground and line-to-line faults in urban cable systems, enabling efficient fault repair. It relies on Ohm's law and series resistors to measure fault distances, displaying accurate results on an Arduino-connected LCD and an IoT interface
